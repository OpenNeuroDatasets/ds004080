# Dataset description
This dataset consists of 74 patients age 4-51 years old where Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potentials (CCEPs) were measured with Electro-CorticoGraphy (ECoG) during single pulse electrical stimulation. For a detailed description see:

# Data organization
This data is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification. A community-driven specification for organizing neurophysiology data along with its metadata. For more information on this data specification, see https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 

Each patient has their own folder (e.g., `sub-ccepAgeUMCU01` to `sub-ccepAgeUMCU75`) which contains the iEEG recordings data for that patient, as well as the metadata needed to understand the raw data and event timing.

Data are logically grouped in the same BIDS session and stored across runs that indicating the day and time point of recording during the monitoring period.
If extra electrodes were added/removed during this period, the session was divided into different sessions (e.g. ses-1a and ses-1b). 
We use the optional run key-value pair to specify the day and the start time of the recording (e.g. run-021315, day 2 after implantation, which is day 1 of the monitoring period, at 13:15).
The task key-value pair in long-term iEEG recordings describes the patient's state during the recording of this file. The task label is “SPESclin“ since these files contain data collected during clinical single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES). 

Electrode positions include Destrieux atlas labels that were estimated by running Freesurfer on the individual subject MRI scan and taking the most common surface label within a sphere around the electrode. All shared electrode positions were then converted to MNI152 space using the Freesurfer surface based non-linear transformation. We note that this surface based transformation distorts the dimensions of the grids, but maintains the gyral anatomy.
