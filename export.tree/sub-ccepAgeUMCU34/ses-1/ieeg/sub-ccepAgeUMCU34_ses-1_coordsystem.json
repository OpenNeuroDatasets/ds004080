	"iEEGCoordinateSystemDescription": "The fsaverage is a dual template providing both volumetric and surface coordinates references. The volumetric template corresponds to a FreeSurfer variant of MNI305 space.",
	"iEEGCoordinateProcessingDescription": "Surface projection to correct for brain-shift and fsaverage positions were calculated using Freesurfer's surface based transformations to MNI305 space. While the surface based transformation distorts the grid dimensions, it maintains accurate gyral electrode positions",
